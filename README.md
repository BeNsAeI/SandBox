# SandBox
- Unity SandBox with realsense R200
- For CG model of the setup look at folder "Model\-for\-setup/Renders"
Hardware:
+Projector:
- ELMO BOXi MP-350 Mobile Projector
-  Mirror

+Realsense Camera
- F200 / R200 camera (Preferably F200 since the setup will be well in range and it provides higher depth DPI)

+Computer
-  NUC or a small PC
     * (I recommend a beefy computer if it needs to be a stand-alone setup.)

+Sand Box
- white sand (~2300 cubic inches or 1.3 cubic feet or ~120 lbs of normal sand)
     * (I recommend a lighter material than Aquarium white sand since it is too heavy)
-  Box: 30" x ~30" x 5" 
     * (I recommend buying a table since it needs to be able to take the weight)

+Frame:
- Dimensions: 30" x ~30" x ~30" (max range of F200 is 1.2 meters or ~47")
- Wooden legs or PVC or Copper pipes, Painted
     * (I recommend PVC pipes since it is very easy to assemble)
