# SandBox
- Unity SandBox with realsense R200
- For CG model of the setup look at folder "Model\-for\-setup/Renders"
Hardware:
+Projector:
     - ELMO BOXi MP-350 Mobile Projector
     - Mirror

+Realsense Camera
     - F200 / R200 camera (Preferably F200 since the setup will be well in range and it provides higher depth DPI)

+Computer
     - NUC or a small PC
           * (I recommend a beefy computer if it needs to be a stand-alone setup.)

+Sand Box
     -white sand (~2300 cubic inches or 1.3 cubic feet or ~120 lbs of normal sand)
          * (I recommend a lighter material than Aquarium white sand since it is too heavy)
     - Box: 30" x ~30" x 5" 
          * (I recommend buying a table since it needs to be able to take the weight)

+Frame:
     - Dimensions: 30" x ~30" x ~30" (max range of F200 is 1.2 meters or ~47")
     - Wooden legs or PVC or Copper pipes, Painted
          * (I recommend PVC pipes since it is very easy to assemble)

Project Title & Description:
Sand-Box
The purpose of this project is to turn a physical shape of plane into digital data to be analysed by computer. Setup of this project contains a sand box that could be move around by hand and shaped into terrain features such as rivers, lakes or mountains. The computer will analyse the data from the sandbox using a specialized camera. Then, the computer analyses this data and calculates the topographical information related to the terrain. The software will color code different regions based on the geographical features of the terrain model and projects the data on the white sand.

Objectives To be Met:
- Building the setup
- Building the software
- Testing the software
- Demo

Evaluation of Objectives:
Evaluation of the objective will be based on submission of following:
- Documented report about purpose of each section of setup. (Short, <1 Week)
- Documented Step-by-Step guide of setup assembly. (Short, <1 Week)
- The completed hardware setup. (Long, ~2 Weeks)
- Documented report of software features and progress (Long, 2-3 Weeks )
- Demo (Long, 2-3 Weeks)
